A multisig-enabled wallet interface with time-lock features to increase the security of user-held Bitcoin.

#### 🧠 SatoshiAI (Coming Soon)
An experimental AI-powered assistant for traders and lenders in the DeFi space. It uses historical blockchain data, market trends, and behavioral patterns to support smarter decisions.
